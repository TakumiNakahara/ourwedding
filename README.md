## Purpose of this site

When I held my wedding party, I wanted to share all the pictures with the attendees. However, there were so many pictures that I wanted to share that I decided to create a website to share them all.

## How did I developed this web sites 

I developed this website with Vue.js since I needed to upload over 1000 pictures. It had to be efficient to allow users to browse the site smoothly. Additionally, it didn't need to have a high SEO ranking. Therefore, I decided to use Vue.js.

## What I struggled?

I struggled to improve the page load speed. I used many methods to achieve this, such as implementing lazy-loading and compressing images.
